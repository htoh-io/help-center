Yes, thanks to [HtoH Trip ConnectÂ©](/en/htoh-trip-connect/what-is-htoh-trip-connect-c), book, and it's imported!

If you haven't created the trip beforehand, no problem, **a trip is automatically created**, without any action on your part, to incorporate your reservation.

<span style="background-color:moccasin;">Conversely, you cannot create an appointment or import a reservation without assigning it to a trip.</span>

By default, when a trip is automatically created, it is named **Trip to \[Destination City Name\]**. To modify it, read [How to modify or delete a trip?](/en/trips-management/how-to-modify-or-delete-a-trip)

Check the different cases where a trip is automatically created:

* [You booked with your company's tool or travel agency](/en/htoh-trip-connect/i-booked-with-my-company-s-tool-or-travel-agency-how-do-i-retrieve-my-reservation)
* [You forwarded a reservation by email](/en/htoh-trip-connect/how-to-import-my-reservation-through-email-transfer)
