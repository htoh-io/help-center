title: I made a reservation with my company's tool, but it is still not imported
---

1. Book through the tool
2. Once payment is made, the retrieval of the reservation may take a few minutes
3. Please wait **up to 5 minutes** for your reservation to be imported. You will receive a notification when the import is completed
4. Open the notification to view your reservation in your trip.

If you haven't received a confirmation email from your provider, it means the reservation has not yet been made by your agency or has not been approved by your hierarchy. Therefore, it cannot be imported into the app.

### If the issue persists

1. First, contact your travel agency provider using the numbers and emails provided in the HtoH assistance tab to check the status of your reservation. Has it been processed?
2. If the reservation has been validated but the issue persists or you receive no notification, contact our support at [support@htoh.io](mailto:support@htoh.io)
