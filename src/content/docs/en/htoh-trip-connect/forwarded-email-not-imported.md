title: I forwarded an email to my @htoh.app address, but it's not imported
---

## Did I follow the procedure correctly?

1. Forward the booking confirmation email to your @htoh.app address ([learn more here](/en/htoh-trip-connect/how-to-import-booking-via-email))
2. Wait **up to 5 minutes** for your booking to be imported. You will receive a notification when the import is completed.
3. Open the notification to view your booking in your trip.

After forwarding the booking confirmation email, move on to other tasks; our HtoH Trip Connect technology handles the job!

## Importation didn't work

Occasionally, the import of a booking may fail for various reasons:

* The provider of the booking is not listed [among our 700 partners](/en/htoh-trip-connect/supported-booking-email-types)
* The language of the email is not recognized by our [HtoH Trip ConnectÂ©](/en/htoh-trip-connect/what-is-htoh-trip-connect) technology
* The email template you forwarded is incorrect; [the booking confirmation email is the only one that is truly reliable!](/en/htoh-trip-connect/which-email-should-be-forwarded)

In any case, if your booking email was forwarded successfully but could not be transcribed, you will receive a notification on your phone informing you of this.
