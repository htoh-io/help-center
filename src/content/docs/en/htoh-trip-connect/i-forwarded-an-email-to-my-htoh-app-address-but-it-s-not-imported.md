title: I forwarded an email to my @htoh.app address, but it's not imported

## Did I follow the procedure correctly?

1. Forward the reservation confirmation email to your @htoh.app address ([learn more here](/en/htoh-trip-connect/how-to-import-my-reservation-through-email-transfer))
2. Wait **up to 5 minutes** for your reservation to be imported. You will receive a notification when the import is completed.
3. Open the notification to view your reservation in your trip.

## Importation didn't work

Occasionally, the import of a reservation may fail for various reasons:

* The provider of the reservation is not listed [among our 700 partners](/en/htoh-trip-connect/what-type-of-reservation-can-i-import-through-email-transfer)
* The language of the email is not recognized by our [HtoH Trip ConnectÂ©](/en/htoh-trip-connect/what-is-htoh-trip-connect-c) technology
* The email template you forwarded is incorrect; [the reservation confirmation email is the only one that is truly reliable!](/en/htoh-trip-connect/what-type-of-email-should-i-forward-to-import-a-reservation)

In any case, if your reservation email was forwarded successfully but could not be transcribed, you will receive a notification on your phone informing you of this.
