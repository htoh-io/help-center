<span style="background-color:palegreen;"></span>When you book [with your company's internal tool or travel agency](/en/htoh-trip-connect/bookings-from-agency), or through the app, you don't need to do anythingâ€”your reservations are automatically retrieved!

However, if you book independently on tools and travel sites that everyone uses for personal purposesâ€”flight and train comparators, car rental sites, accommodation sites like Booking.com, Airbnb, etc.â€”you'll need to follow the steps above to import those reservations.
