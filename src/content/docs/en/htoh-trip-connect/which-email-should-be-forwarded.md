title: What type of email should I forward to import a booking?
---

## The confirmation email from the provider is the only one that's truly reliable!

* For optimal retrieval of information by [HtoH Trip ConnectÂ©](/en/htoh-trip-connect/what-is-htoh-trip-connect) technology, the confirmation email typically contains a comprehensive summary of your booking: **Destination, Dates, Price, Departure Airport or Station, Arrival Airport or Station, Booking Number, Reference...**
* HtoH Trip Connect can automatically import bookings from over 770 providers! ([Check the exhaustive list of providers in this article](/en/htoh-trip-connect/supported-booking-email-types))

:::caution
Excessive and unjustified email forwarding may result in additional charges to your employer.
:::

You can attach any other necessary travel-related documents by directly adding them as attachments to your travel segment: Payment confirmation, Correspondence with the provider, Support, Marketing email, Promotional offer, Registration confirmation or forgot password email, Ticket, Boarding pass, and others.
