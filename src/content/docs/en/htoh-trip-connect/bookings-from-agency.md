title: I booked with my company's booking tool or travel agency, how do I retrieve my booking?
---

Whether it's through a corporate booking tool or your employer's travel agency, the process is the same, **you don't have to do anything!**

## I booked through my company's booking tool

Examples of company tools: KDS, TravelCash, The Treep, Rydoo, TripActions, TravelPerk, ...

1. Make your booking through the tool
2. Once payment is made, retrieving the booking may take a few minutes
3. You'll receive a notification on your phone when the import is complete
4. Open the notification to view your booking in your trip agenda

## I booked directly with the travel agency

1. Call or email your agency to make the booking.
2. Once the booking is made, retrieval may take a few minutes.
3. You'll receive a notification on your phone when the import is complete.
4. Open the notification to view your booking in your trip agenda

The import also depends on your travel agency's processing time. If you haven't received a confirmation email, it means the booking hasn't been made by your agency yet, so it can't be imported into the app.

:::note
In both cases, after making the booking, move on to something else, our HtoH Trip Connect technology does the job!
