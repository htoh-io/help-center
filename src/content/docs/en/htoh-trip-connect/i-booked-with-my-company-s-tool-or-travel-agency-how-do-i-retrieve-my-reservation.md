Whether it's through a corporate tool or your employer's travel agency, the process is the same, **you don't have to do anything!**

## I booked through my company's tool

<span style="background-color:lightcyan;">Examples of company tools: KDS, TravelCash, The Treep, Rydoo, TripActions, TravelPerk, ...</span>

1. Make your reservation through the tool
2. Once payment is made, retrieving the reservation may take a few minutes
3. You'll receive a notification on your phone when the import is complete
4. Open the notification to view your reservation in your trip agenda

## I booked directly with the travel agency

1. <span style="background-color:moccasin;"></span>Call or email your agency to make the reservation.
2. Once the reservation is made, retrieval may take a few minutes.
3. You'll receive a notification on your phone when the import is complete.
4. Open the notification to view your reservation in your trip agenda

The import also depends on your travel agency's processing time. If you haven't received a confirmation email, it means the reservation hasn't been made by your agency yet, so it can't be imported into the app.

<span style="background-color:moccasin;">**Tip:**</span><span style="background-color:moccasin;"> In both cases, after making the reservation, move on to something else, our HtoH Trip Connect technology does the job!</span>
