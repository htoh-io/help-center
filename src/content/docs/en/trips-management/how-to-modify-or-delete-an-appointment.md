### Good to know

* The ability to modify an appointment works with appointments entered directly into your calendar from the HtoH App.
* Appointments resulting from the synchronization of your calendar with HtoH can be deleted from your trip, but not modified. To do this, you must modify them directly in your phone's calendar or from Outlook.
