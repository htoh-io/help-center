If you sync your calendar with the app for the first time, you may receive a phone alert to approve the import of your calendar data

1. On the homepage, click on **Sync with Calendar**
2. Simply select the calendars to sync
3. Once you've selected your calendars, it's synchronized; just return to the homepage
4. Make sure the icon on the button is green, indicating that the synchronization is active

All events from your synchronized calendars are automatically imported, with no action required on your part, into your existing trips only. In other words, events without pre-existing trips on the same dates are not imported.

Finally, synchronization is one-way, from your calendar to the HtoH app, but not the other way around. Events from your trips are not imported into your calendar.

<span style="background-color:moccasin;">**Note:**</span><span style="background-color:moccasin;"> To prevent the HtoH calendar from being biased by events in your calendar over multiple days, we have decided to automatically exclude the import of events from your calendar if the first day and/or last day are not within your trip.</span>
