1. On the homepage, to the right of the title **Upcoming Trips**, click on **View All**
2. Access your past trips by clicking on the **Past** tab and your upcoming trips by clicking on **Upcoming**

By default, past trips are sorted in reverse chronological order (from most recent to oldest), while upcoming trips are in chronological order (from closest to farthest).


This is also how you can access the satisfaction survey for each trip. Your feedback matters! In just two clicks, you'll have the opportunity to share your feelings, provide feedback, and suggest improvements.
