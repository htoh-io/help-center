Sometimes, when you're waiting for a reservation import or creating a new trip, it may be necessary to force the refresh of information within HtoH.

By simply pulling down on these pages, the information will automatically update after a brief loading moment. This gesture works on the following screens:

* Homepage
* Trip Timeline
* Trip List

## Pull to refresh

The "Pull to Refresh" function is an intuitive mechanism designed to update an application's content with a simple user gesture. The fundamental principle is to pull down the screen and release it to trigger data refresh.
