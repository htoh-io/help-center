In each trip agenda, you can see the weather forecast for each day:

1. Go to a trip.
2. At the beginning of each new day, the weather is indicated by an icon along with the estimated maximum and minimum temperatures for the entire day.

Rest assured, these weather forecasts are for the dates scheduled for your trips.
