If you encounter a display issue or if the mobile application crashes, you can report it by sending an email to [support@htoh.io](mailto:support@htoh.io) with the following information **for each problem**:

1. A detailed description of the problem encountered
2. The exact model of your phone (for example: iPhone 14 Pro Max, Samsung Galaxy S23, etc.)
3. A screenshot if the issue is visible on a specific screen, and/or a video recording if it involves a series of actions. When in doubt, prefer a video recording.
