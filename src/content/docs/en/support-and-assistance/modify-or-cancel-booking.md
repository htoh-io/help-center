### Directly contact the provider responsible for your reservation.

Contact customer services directly from the application by clicking on the **Assistance** button.

Depending on the services you have access to, you will find telephone numbers and/or email addresses there:

* Customer service of your employer's travel agency
* Hotel customer service
* Expenses customer service
* Your company's support
* For a reservation

HtoH is primarily a travel companion that accompanies you throughout your journeys and helps you centralize everything, **so the HtoH team is not able to directly handle your reservations**.

To modify or cancel a reservation, contact the provider (Flight, Train, Car Rental, or Hotel) or your authorized employer's travel agency first.
