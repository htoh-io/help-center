For any inquiries or emergencies regarding your reservations, you can directly contact the relevant travel provider through HtoH. Click on the Assistance tab accessible from all screens of your travel companion.

From the Assistance tab of your HtoH travel companion, depending on the services available to you, you can contact the customer service of the referenced providers via email or phone:

* Travel agency
* Hotel platform
* Car rental company
* Traveler services

### Reminder

* To avoid disputes or billing for unused services, you should modify or cancel a reservation and contact the provider (Flight, Train, Car rental, or Hotel) or your employer's authorized travel agency whose contact information is available in the Assistance tab. You can use HtoH to access your company's booking tools to perform these operations if necessary.
* HtoH is primarily a travel companion that accompanies you throughout your journeys and helps you centralize everything. **HtoH team is unable to handle your reservations or connect you with any service, even in emergencies or force majeure situations.**
