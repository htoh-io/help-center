## I don't receive any emails from HtoH

Our password recovery and login code emails should work for most of email providers.

However in some cases you might have issues of receiving them. Here are our recommended
steps to take:

1. Check your inbox's spam folder. If you find our emails there, please mark them
as non-spam so that your email provider won't put them in spam again in the future.
2. If you still don't find them in your spam, that might be related to your email
provider. It is a known problem with some emails like @wanadoo.fr, @orange.fr, etc.
In this case:
 - If you have provided your mobile phone previously, you can try the option of login
 code via SMS.
 - Otherwise, you can contact us [support@htoh.io](mailto:support@htoh.io) to get help.
