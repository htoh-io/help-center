## **Log in to the application with a temporary code**

If you prefer passwordless login, connect using a temporary code. Equally secure, this login system involves receiving a code sent to your email address, valid for 5 minutes and for one-time use:

1. Open the application and click on **Log in**
2. Enter your email address and click on **Log in with temporary code**
3. Confirm your email address by clicking **Receive a temporary code** again
4. You instantly receive a 6-digit code by email in your inbox.
5. Return to the application to enter or copy and paste this code.
6. Click **Log in** and the adventure can begin!

## Log in to the application with a password

If you prefer to create a password, you also have the option, and the principle is the same:

1. Open the application and click on **Log in**
2. Enter your email address and click on **Log in with a password**
3. Then follow the instructions to create your password

If you have forgotten your password or are having trouble logging in, see [How to reset my password?](/en/support-and-assistance/reset-password)

## **Enable notifications**

Upon first login, your phone asks if you want to enable notifications; we recommend approving notification activation to be alerted in real-time. Here's [How to enable or disable HtoH system notifications on my phone?](/en/trips-management/system-notifications)
