## Log in to the application with a temporary code via email

If you prefer passwordless login, you can use using a temporary code. Equally secure, this login system involves receiving a code sent to your email address, valid for 5 minutes and for one-time use:

1. Open the application and click on **Log in**
2. Enter your email address and click on **Continue with login code**.
3. Confirm your email address by clicking **Send me a code via email** again
4. You instantly receive a 6-digit code by email in your inbox.
5. Return to the application to enter or copy and paste this code.
6. Click **Log in** and the adventure can begin!

## Login to application with a temporary code via SMS

This login option is the same as [the temporary code via email](#log-in-to-the-application-with-a-temporary-code-via-email) mentionned above.
If you've provided your mobile number previously in HtoH app, you can use this option.

It can also help if for some reasons, you cannot receive login codes by email.

1. Open the application and click on **Log in**
2. Enter your email address and click on **Continue with login code**.
3. Confirm your email address by clicking **Send me a code via SMS** again
4. You instantly receive a 6-digit code via SMS.
5. Return to the application to enter or copy and paste this code.
6. Click **Log in** and the adventure can begin!

## Log in to the application with a password

If you prefer to create a password, you also have the option, and the principle is the same:

1. Open the application and click on **Log in**
2. Enter your email address and click on **Log in with a password**
3. Then follow the instructions to create your password

If you have forgotten your password or are having trouble logging in, see [How to reset my password?](/en/support-and-assistance/reset-password)

## **Enable notifications**

Upon first login, your phone asks if you want to enable notifications; we recommend approving notification activation to be alerted in real-time. Here's [How to enable or disable HtoH system notifications on my phone?](/en/trips-management/system-notifications)
