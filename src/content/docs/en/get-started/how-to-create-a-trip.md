## Create a trip automatically

If you import a reservation using [HtoH Trip ConnectÂ©](/en/htoh-trip-connect/what-is-htoh-trip-connect) technology but have not previously created the trip, no problem, a trip is automatically created, without any action on your part, to include your reservation. To learn more, [see this article](/en/htoh-trip-connect/import-booking-without-creating-the-trip).
